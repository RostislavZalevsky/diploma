                Relevance of the topic of the bachelor's thesis: software and hardware for accepting payments using Stripe and PayPal. The urgency of creating such a software and hardware complex for business. It has the ability for customers to pay by card through online payments. The relevance of developing this payment system is the acquisition of skills and abilities to create online payments for a business project based on the Raspberry Pi.

                Today, the Raspberry Pi is no longer just a microcomputer for exploring the world of microelectronics, automation and learning the basics of programming, but a powerful tool for implementing projects with machine learning and artificial intelligence.
            </p>
            <p>
                The relevance of the chosen topic of the bachelor's thesis is due to the fact that computers are used everywhere, but not all the functions and capabilities of this computer are used to perform the task. Raspberry can only be configured for one task. Also, the Raspberry Pi has a very low cost compared to conventional personal computers, which is undoubtedly another plus. Therefore, the theme of the bachelor's work is the acquisition of skills, the ability to create a payment system, acquaintance with single-board computers Raspberry Pi, based on Raspberry Pi.

                The Raspberry Pi has an unlimited number of applications, as it can connect various modules and any parts. In addition, together with devices such as the Raspberry Pi, they use technology such as IoT, which is the last stage of the Internet, in short, it is a concept of computer networks that connect all mobile and not just devices and provide autonomous work without human intervention.

                Purpose: development of software and hardware for receiving payments based on Raspberry Pi.
            </p>
            <p>
                Object: methods of automated payment on the Internet, network payment management technologies.
            </p>
            <p>
                Subject: ¬ hardware and software complex of automated payment acceptance based on Raspberry Pi using Laravel framework and PHP programming language.
            </p>
            <p>
                To achieve this goal it is necessary to solve the following tasks of the bachelor's thesis:
            </p>
            <p>
                – to substantiate the choice of methods, means and technologies of development from the analytical review of the literature and patent information;
            </p>
            <p>
                – explore the advantages and disadvantages of existing automatic payment systems;
            </p>
            <p>
                – develop software and testing;
            </p>
            <p>
                – connect a payment system, database;
            </p>
            <p>
                – install equipment based on Raspberry Pi;
            </p>
            <p>
                – development of labor protection issues when working on a personal computer.
            </p>
            <p>
                The practical significance of the obtained results: obtained in the work, mastering modern forms and methods of working with a set of problems, solving at the enterprise using computer engineering. Acquisition of necessary skills in carrying out operations of technological process of information processing.
